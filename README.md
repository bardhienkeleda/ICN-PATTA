# ICN-PATTA

This repo contains the source code for the implementation of our paper entitled *ICN PATTA: ICN Privacy Attack Through Traffic Analysis*.
The project contains two main modules:
1. Classifiers setup: used for classifiers training phase.
2. Real time classification: used for mini-NDN simulations and real time classification by the attacker.
